<h1>The background Property</h1>

<p>The background property is a shorthand property for specifying all the background properties in one declaration.</p>

<p>Here, the background image is only shown once, and it is also positioned in the top-right corner.</p>

<p>We have also added a right margin, so that the text will not write over the background image.</p>

<!--When using the shorthand property the order of the property values is:

background-color
background-image
background-repeat
background-attachment
background-position

It does not matter if one of the property values is missing, as long as the other ones are in this order. Note that we do not use the background-attachment property in the examples above, as it does not have a value.-->
